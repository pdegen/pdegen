"The defeatist belief that all pursuits arise from a selfish core in all humanity denies the deeper motives that also activate people: love, creativity, spiritual quest, the drive for mastery and autonomy, the impulse to make a contribution.",Gabor Maté,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction

"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.",Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail
"If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.",Kurt Vonnegut,A Man Without a Country
"Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war. Or, more accurately, our economy is at war with many forms of life on earth, including human life. What the climate needs to avoid collapse is a contraction in humanity's use of resources; what our economic model demands to avoid collapse is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it's not the laws of nature.",Naomi Klein,This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate

"Now you listen to me. While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact is that I am a naysayer and hatchetman in the fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch and I'll gladly take another because I choose to live my life in the company of Gandhi and King. My concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge, aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a method... is love. I love you Sheriff Truman.",Albert Rosenfield,Twin Peaks

"Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast from me wasn't a demon: it was me.",Tara Westover,Educated
"Zum Wesen der Wissenschaften wie der Künste gehört, dass sie ihrem Bedürfnis voraus sind; zum Wesen des Markets gehört, dass er auf die gegenwärtigen Bedürfnisse antwortet. Wissenschaften und Künste brauchen die Freiheit, das zu suchen und zu erschaffen, was niemand erwartet, niemand verlangt, das, wofür es keinen Markt gibt.",Peter von Matt,Das Kalb vor der Gotthardpost
"Paul Dirac was notoriously a man of few words. Dick Feynman told the story that when he first met Dirac at a conference, Dirac said after a long silence, 'I have an equation; do you have one too?'",Anthony Zee,Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell
"But the truth is that nothing of much consequence in the face of our rigged systems can be accomplished on our own—whether by our own small selves or even by our own identity groups. Change requires collaboration and coalition, even (especially) uncomfortable coalition. Mariame Kaba, a longtime prison abolitionist who has done as much as anyone to imagine what it would take to live in a world that does not equate safety with police and cages, puts the lesson succinctly, one passed on to her by her father: 'Everything worthwhile is done with other people.'",Naomi Klein, Doppelganger
"And not surprisingly, for if science is about studying the world as it actually is—rather than as we wish it to be—then science will always have the potential to unsettle the status quo. As an independent source of authority and knowledge, science has always had the capacity to challenge ruling powers' ability to control people by controlling their beliefs. Indeed, it has the power to challenge anyone who wishes to preserve, protect, or defend the status quo.",Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,Merchants of Doubt

"Witnessing the blind, seething, thoughtless campaigns against MMR and GM—which minor the infantile train of thought that 'homeopathy works because the Vioxx side-effects were covered up by Merck'—it's easy to experience a pervasive sense of lost political opportunities, that somehow all of our valuable indignation about development issues, the role of big money in our society, and frank corporate malpractice, is being diverted away from anywhere it could be valid and useful, and into puerile, mythical fantasies.",Ben Goldacre,Bad Science
"It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction…When an honest man speaks, he says only what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.",Ben Goldacre,Bad Science
"Without our active economic citizenship, we will always be the victims of people who have greater ability to make decisions, who tell us that things happen because they have to and therefore that there is nothing we can do to alter them, however unpleasant and unjust they may appear.",Ha-Joon Chang,23 Things They Don't Tell You about Capitalism
"A more holistic way of thinking about growth is to recognise that it is broadly equivalent to the rate at which our economy is metabolising the living world.",Jason Hickel,Less Is More
"But the experience of all effective movements also shows that success is a function of their preparedness for a moment of transformation. It may come unexpectedly, caused by entirely unrelated forces. Sometimes the role of entire generations is simply to make ready, develop their arguments, tell their stories, build their campaigns, for an opportunity their successors can seize.",George Monbiot,Regenesis
"Let's imagine it was the other way round. Imagine that the world was currently producing most of its protein and much of its fat from microbes in breweries, occupying, in total, the land area of a small European province, and fed and powered by clean electricity. Imagine that my evil, anagrammatic twin, Tom Go-Bioregen, wrote a book with the following argument. 'I've got this great idea. Let's shut down the food factories. Let's replace the food they make by catching some wild animals – aurochs, wild boar, jungle fowl and a woolly ruminant from Mesopotamia would do – modifying them drastically and breeding them in stupendous numbers. Let's separate the young from their mothers, castrate them, dock their tails, clip their beaks, teeth and horns without anaesthesia, herd them into barns and cages, subject them to extreme boredom and sensory deprivation for their short, distressing lives, then corral them into giant factories where we stun them, cut their throats, skin, pluck and hack their bloody flesh into chunks that you, the lucky customer, will want to eat (oh yes you will!). I've done the sums – we'd need to slaughter only 75 billion animals a year.  'Let's kill the baby aurochs, extract a chemical from the lining of their fourth stomachs and mix it with milk from lactating mothers of the same species, to create a wobbly mass of fat and protein. We'll stir in some live bacteria to digest this mass, then let their excrements sit till they go hard and yellow and start to stink. You're really going to want this! 'Let's fell the forests, drain the wetlands, seize the wild grasslands, expel the indigenous people, kill the large predators, exclude the wild herbivores, trigger the global collapse of wildlife, climate breakdown and the destruction of the habitable planet. Let's fence most of this land for our captive animals to graze, and plant the rest with crops to make them fat. Let's spray the crops with biocidal toxins and minerals that'll leach into the soil and water. Let's divert the rivers and drain the aquifers. Let's pour billions of tonnes of shit into the sea. Let's trigger repeated plagues, transmitted to humans by the animals we've captured, and destroy the efficacy of our most important medicines. 'Sure, it will trash everything after a while, but think of the fun we'll have. Come on, you know you want this.' I hope you would run this scoundrel out of town.",George Monbiot,Regenesis
