"The defeatist belief that all pursuits arise from a selfish core in all humanity denies the deeper motives that also activate people: love, creativity, spiritual quest, the drive for mastery and autonomy, the impulse to make a contribution.",Gabor Maté,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction
"The most important assumptions of a model are not in the equations, but what’s not in them; not in the documentation, but unstated; not in the variables on the computer screen, but in the blank spaces around them.",Kate Raworth,Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.",Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail
"If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.",Kurt Vonnegut,A Man Without a Country
"Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war. Or, more accurately, our economy is at war with many forms of life on earth, including human life. What the climate needs to avoid collapse is a contraction in humanity’s use of resources; what our economic model demands to avoid collapse is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it’s not the laws of nature.",Naomi Klein,This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate
"The ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.",David Graeber,
"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.",Carl Sagan,Cosmos
"Zombie no go go, unless you tell 'em to go (zombie)
Zombie no go stop, unless you tell 'em to stop (zombie)
Zombie no go turn, unless you tell 'em to turn (zombie)
Zombie no go think, unless you tell 'em to think (zombie)",Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Afrika 70,Zombie
"I would like to make a film to tell children it's good to be alive.",Hayao Miyazaki,
"Now you listen to me. While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact is that I am a naysayer and hatchetman in the fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch and I'll gladly take another because I choose to live my life in the company of Gandhi and King. My concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge, aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a method... is love. I love you Sheriff Truman.",Albert Rosenfield,Twin Peaks
"I know kung fu.",Neo,The Matrix
"Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast from me wasn’t a demon: it was me.",Tara Westover,Educated
"Zum Wesen der Wissenschaften wie der Künste gehört, dass sie ihrem Bedürfnis voraus sind; zum Wesen des Markets gehört, dass er auf die gegenwärtigen Bedürfnisse antwortet. Wissenschaften und Künste brauchen die Freiheit, das zu suchen und zu erschaffen, was niemand erwartet, niemand verlangt, das, wofür es keinen Markt gibt.",Peter von Matt,Das Kalb vor der Gotthardpost
"Paul Dirac was notoriously a man of few words. Dick Feynman told the story that when he first met Dirac at a conference, Dirac said after a long silence, 'I have an equation; do you have one too?'",Anthony Zee,Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell
"But the truth is that nothing of much consequence in the face of our rigged systems can be accomplished on our own—whether by our own small selves or even by our own identity groups. Change requires collaboration and coalition, even (especially) uncomfortable coalition. Mariame Kaba, a longtime prison abolitionist who has done as much as anyone to imagine what it would take to live in a world that does not equate safety with police and cages, puts the lesson succinctly, one passed on to her by her father: 'Everything worthwhile is done with other people.'",Naomi Klein, Doppelganger
"And not surprisingly, for if science is about studying the world as it actually is—rather than as we wish it to be—then science will always have the potential to unsettle the status quo. As an independent source of authority and knowledge, science has always had the capacity to challenge ruling powers’ ability to control people by controlling their beliefs. Indeed, it has the power to challenge anyone who wishes to preserve, protect, or defend the status quo.",Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,Merchants of Doubt
